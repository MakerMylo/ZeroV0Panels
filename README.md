# ZeroV0Panel Clips (*ZeeVo Panels*)
These panel clips were heavily inspired by the original ZeroPanels by zruncho3d.

These clips are released under GPL 3.0 so feel free to modify, remix, distribute & sell.

**What do they solve?**\
The original ZeroPanels were designed mostly for extended extrusion printer for ants, and fitting to the original V0 wasn't easily achievable.

**Assembly**
Follow the assembly guide provided by [zruncho3d](https://github.com/zruncho3d/ZeroPanels/blob/main/README.md).

**Printing**
All parts are printed with [Voron Specs](https://docs.vorondesign.com/sourcing.html#print-settings), and are printed in a *laid flat* orientation.

 * **BOM**
  - 3MM x 5MM Foam Tape - [Amazon](https://amzn.to/4cc1Ne0) | [AliExpress](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DntvAwR)
  - 5mm Wide VHB Tape - [Amazon](https://amzn.to/45db82T) | [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006649591500.html)
  - 2x M3 Heatpress Inserts
  - 2x M3x20 Screws

* **Notable changes to ZeroPanels v3**
  - I have redesigned the hinge mechanism to allow the panels to be printed flat. The hinges don't use magnets this time but take a heatset insert in the lower hinge to keep the M3x20 screw stable and prevent door wobble.
  - I have added the tophat files to allow them to sit over the lower clips giving a much more satisfying fit.
  - Modified all 'top' clips to avoid gantry components.
  - Truly tool-less design, once installed all panels can be removed without tools.
  - Options available for 100 or 80mm tophats.
